    "text": "In recent years, Singapore has become one of the top choices for many Asian overseas workers and international students after the pandemic, an increasing number of people have been moving to Singapore. Moreover, frequent relocations among foreign workers and students, coupled with a market saturated with intermediaries whose pricing is not transparent, have made finding satisfactory accommodation at a reasonable price an inevitable challenge for many international students and foreign workers"

By using the interactive visualisation, we want to see the trend during and after the pandemic period. We also divide into 1 room, 2 rooms, 3 rooms, 4 rooms, 5 rooms in different area such as ANG MO KIO.\nPREESENT:\nThe present price is the most important part. We will use different kinds of charts to display the price by different rooms in different area.\nFUTURE:\nWe will use 2 methods to predict the price in the future. One is the regression to mean, by using CI 95%, this will help us to see the trend in the future. The other is ARIMA model, this model can predict the recent price."
